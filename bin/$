#!/bin/bash
#
# Makes shell handle commands containing a leading `$`.
#
# Especially when it comes to documentation, shell commands are often specified
# using a leading `$`. This introduces a minor inconvenience when it comes to
# copying the commands as the leading `$` will need to be excluded because it
# won't be understood by shells.
#
# This script named `$` runs the arguments passed to it, script that once added
# to the `PATH` will make the shell "ignore" a leading `$`, thus, removing the
# need to exclude the `$` when copying shell commands.
